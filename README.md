## Experiment Todo:

### 1. Ryan: optimize model(gen and dis), loss fn, determine training data size (Steven and John can do it too if you want.)

### 2. Steven and John: 
#### a. read SFKGAN paper (especially, experiment part), and synthetic data evaluation method in this paper (https://amulyayadav.github.io/AI4SG2023/images/7.pdf)
#### b. use the synthetic data in generated_data/fault_01 to build evaluation model/method. After we generate all type of faulty data, we do a complete experiment
#### c. you could modify these evaluation approach and come up with new one.


## Paper writing Todo: (not now)

### Ryan: write abstract, introduction, methodology (model part)
### Steven and John: methodology (evaluation method part)
